One day, a little fish named Fin was swimming near the shore. He saw a big crab and wanted to be friends. "Hi, I am Fin. Do you want to play?" asked the little fish. The crab looked at Fin and said, "No, I don't want to play. I am cold and I don't feel fine."

Fin felt sad but wanted to help the crab feel better. He swam away and thought of a plan. He remembered that the sun could make things warm. So, Fin swam to the top of the water and called to the sun, "Please, sun, help my new friend feel fine and not freeze!"

The sun heard Fin's call and shone its warm light on the shore. The crab started to feel better and not so cold. He saw Fin and said, "Thank you, little fish, for making me feel fine. I don't feel like I will freeze now. Let's play together!" And so, Fin and the crab played and became good friends.
